	<p>Hello, my name is Maddox Cotten. I am a <u>Freshman</u> and <i>first year engineering student</i> here at NC State. I plan to CODA into computer science, as I feel there will be much growth and find <strong>AI</strong> to be very fascinating.

    <p style= "color:#323ca8 ; font-size:32px ; font-family:arial ; text-alignt:center;" > My most prominent job recently was being a line cook. Back in Greensboro, where I am from, I worked the majority of the summer in a kitchen at a local swim and tennis club. I really enjoyed cooking and plan to work there again over winter break!
